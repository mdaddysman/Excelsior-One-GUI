# Excelsior One GUI
A **Excelsior One GUI** is written in Matlab for controling four Spectra-Physics Excelsior One OEM lasers. The program is written to work with four (405, 488, 561, 640 nm) lasers. However, the application can be easily modified for work with different wavelengths and number of lasers. The program supports both [direct diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode) and [diode-pumped solid state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode-pumped_solid-state_laser) laser settings of the [Excelsior One product line](http://www.spectra-physics.com/products/cw-lasers/excelsior-one).
